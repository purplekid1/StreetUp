# Street Up: Simple 7-on-7 Football Rules

## Game Identity
Street Up is a simple, fast American football (gridiron) game focused on street-style 7-on-7 play.

## Core Format
- Teams: 7 players on offense vs 7 players on defense.
- Field: Smaller than full 11-man football (choose one map size and keep it consistent).
- Contact level: Light contact / no full tackling by default.
- Match flow: Short games with quick drives.

## Recommended Team Roles (Simple Version)
- Offense:
	- 1 QB
	- 1 Center (snap only)
	- 1-2 Running Backs / Utility
	- 3-4 Receivers
- Defense:
	- 1 Rusher
	- 2-3 Cover Defenders
	- 2-3 Safeties / Hybrid Defenders

## Simple Possession Rules
- Start each drive at your own 25-yard line (or equivalent marked line).
- Offense has 4 downs to reach a first-down marker.
- First-down distance: 15 yards (or 10 yards on smaller maps).
- If offense fails on 4th down, possession changes at the dead-ball spot.

## Scoring
- Touchdown: 6 points.
- Extra point:
	- 1 point from short try line.
	- 2 points from longer try line.
- Safety: 2 points.
- Optional field goals can be disabled in default mode to keep gameplay simple.

## Play Start and Dead Ball
- Each play starts with a snap from center to QB.
- Ball is dead when:
	- Ball carrier is downed/flagged/tagged (based on game mode).
	- Pass is incomplete.
	- Ball carrier goes out of bounds.
	- Defense records a sack behind line of scrimmage.

## Passing and Rushing Rules
- QB has a short "no-rush" window (example: 2 seconds) before defense can fully rush.
- At least 1 defender may rush every play.
- Forward pass allowed once per play from behind line of scrimmage.
- Lateral/backward passes allowed anytime.
- Optional simple rule: Offense must cross line of scrimmage before running on selected modes.

## Turnovers
- Interceptions: live ball, return allowed.
- Fumbles:
	- Default arcade mode: no fumbles.
	- Simulation-lite mode: fumbles on heavy hit chance.

## Clock and Match Length (Recommended)
- 2 halves.
- 6-8 minutes per half (running clock).
- Final 2 minutes of each half can use stop-clock rules for passes out of bounds, incompletions, and scores.

## Overtime (Simple)
- Each team gets 1 possession from opponent territory.
- If still tied after both possessions, repeat until winner.
- Option: require 2-point tries after second OT round.

## Penalties (Keep Minimal)
Use only a small set of easy-to-understand penalties:
- Offside / Neutral zone infraction.
- False start.
- Pass interference.
- Illegal forward pass (past line of scrimmage).
- Delay of game.

## Street Up Default Ruleset (Suggested v1)
- 7-on-7, American football only.
- No full special teams.
- No punts by default.
- 4 downs, 15 yards for first down.
- Touchdown + 1/2-point conversion tries.
- Fast pace and simple UI prompts.

## Why This Ruleset Works
- Easy for new players to learn quickly.
- Keeps football strategy (routes, reads, coverage) without full 11-man complexity.
- Supports quick online and local matches.

## Next Build Targets
- Player movement and camera tuning (Madden-like but simpler).
- Snap, passing, catching, and tackling/tagging loops.
- First-down and scoring logic.
- Basic play-call screen with a small route tree.
